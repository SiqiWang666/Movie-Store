# Movie Store

This repository is a one stop trip to learn everything about building web application using .NET technologies and modern frontend framework Angular. The project is a movie store web application which offers hundreds of movies for purchase and also a platform for customers to share their reviews about the movies.

This repository contains two different architectures: web api services (ASP.NET Core Web api) plus single page application (Angular 8) and traditional MVC web app (ASP.NET Core MVC).

Note: This guide will focus on SPA and api services and more features are in progress.
